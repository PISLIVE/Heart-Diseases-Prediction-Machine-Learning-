# Heart Disease Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease using clinical features such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more.

The model is built in Python using scikit-learn (Logistic Regression as the main algorithm). The project was created and developed in Google Colab.

## Project contents

- `heart_disease_model.ipynb`  
  Jupyter/Colab notebook containing:
  - Data loading
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Model training (Logistic Regression)
  - Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve, AUC)

## How to run this notebook

1. Download the notebook from this repo or open it directly in Google Colab.
2. Make sure you have the heart disease dataset (for example `heart.csv`) available.
3. Upload the dataset in Colab or change the file path in the notebook according to your environment.
4. Run the cells in order.

## Technologies used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Future improvements

- Try other models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost)
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV)
- Build a simple web app using Streamlit or Flask for user-friendly prediction
